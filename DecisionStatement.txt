iii)else-if ladder:
->whenever we have more then 2 condition and it needs to execute any one of it, we use else-if ladder.
Syntax:
if(condition)
{
//java statements
}
else if(condition)
{
//java statements
}
else if(condition)
{
//java statements
}
else if(condition)
{
//java statements
}
---
else
{
//java statements
}

iv)Switch:
->when ever we need to take the decision based on the value we use switch statements.
Syntax:
Switch(value/Exp)
{
case(value/Exp):
{
//java Statements
}
case(value/Exp):
{
//java Statements
}
---
default:
{
//java statements
}
}

v)break:
->is a keyword
->it is also called as Control transfer statements
->break will stops the execution and transfer the control out of the block
note: break can be used only inside the Switch statements or loop statements
ex: if(true)
{
System.out.println("hello");
break;
System.out.println("bye");
