Relationship:
->the connection between two Objects is known Relationship.
-> we have 2 types:
1)IS-A 
2)HAS-A

1)HAS-A:
->The connection between the whole Objects and the part of it.
ex: car HAS-A Engine

2)IS-A:
->its a relationship between parent and child where child acquires all the properties of parent.
ex: Car IS-A Vehicle

**Purpose of IS-A relationship:
->main purpose of IS-A relationship is to achieve "Generalization" as well as "Specialization".

->Bottom-Top approach is called as Generalization
->Top-Bottom approach is called as Specialization

note:we can achieve IS-A relationship using 'Inheritance'.

**Inheritance:
->is a design principal which is used to achieve is-a relationship between the two "Objects" where one object acquires the properties of another object

*Parent-class:
->the class which provides states and behaviour to another class

*child-Object:
->an object which acquires the properties of another object

**We can achieve inheritance between class by 2 keyword:
1)extends
2)implements

*solid arrow represents extends
*Dotted arrow represents implements.
