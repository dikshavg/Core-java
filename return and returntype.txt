*return:
->it is a keyword
->it is also known as control transfer statement
->return will destroy the frame and transfer the control back to calling method
note:return statement should be the last statement in a block else we get compile time error
ex: System.out.println("main begin");
return;//CTE
System.out.println("main end");

*return-type:
->can a method return a value to its caller:
yes, we call return the following types of data/literals.
1)numericals
2)character
3)string
4)Boolean
->it is the type of value that we returning from the method

ex1:
public static int print()
{
System.out.println("from print()");//CTE
}

ex2:
public static int print()
{
System.out.println("From print()");
return;//CTE
}

ex3:
public static int print()
{
System.out.println("From print());
return 10;//CTS
}
