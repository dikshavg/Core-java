PART-II:
*class:
->class is a keyword, it is used to design a user define non-primitive datatype to store the details of object.
Syntax:
class Name
{
}
->class is also considered as blue-print of an object.
->inside a class we can create members like method as well as variables
ex:
class calci
{
string branch;
double price;
string colour;
void add()
{
}
void sub()
{
}

->in java every class name can be a non-primitive datatype
->every class name act like a non-primitive datatype there for we can hav n-number of non-primitive data types
============================================================================================
*members of a class:
->Anything which is declared inside the class-block is known as members of a class

*class members are classified into 2 types:
1)static members
2)non-static members

1)static members:
->static is a keyword
->it is a non-access modifier
===============================================================================================
*Static:
->static is a keyword
->it is a non-access modifier

*Static members:
->any class member which is prefix with static modifier is known as static member of a class.
->we have following static members:
1)static method
2)static variable
3)static initializers

2)Non-static members:
->any class members which is not prefix with static modifier 
->we have 4 types:
1)non-static method
2)non-static variable
3)non-static initializer
4)Constructor
===========================================================================================
1)static method:
->a method which is prefixed with static modifier known as static method
ex:

class p1
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
System.out.println("main begin");
test();
System.out.println("main end");
}
static void test()
{
System.out.println("test begin"):
System.out.println("test end");
}
}

*Access Operator:
->it is a binary Operator
->it is used to access the member present in a particular location/Address
Syntax: LHS.RHS

*Static variable:
->a global variable which is prefix with static modifier 
-*points to be remember:
1)static variable have the memory allocation inside the class static area
2)every global variable have default value
->class name with access operator
->directly with help of name

class p1
{
static int a;
}

class p2
{
static double a;
}

class Driver1
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
System.out.println(p1.a)//0
System.out.println(p2.a);//0.0
}
}
