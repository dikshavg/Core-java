*Logical Operator:
1)AND Operator
2)OR Operator
3)Not Operator

1)AND Operator:
->it is binary Operator
->whenever we need to satisfy multiple conditions to perform a task we use && operator
->we can use && Operator between the conditions that is between the Boolean value
->the return type is Boolean
ex: int a=10;
int b=20;
System.out.println(a>b && ++a<b);//false
System.out.println(a);//10
System.out.println(b);//20

2)OR Operator:
->it is binary Operator
->whenever we need to satisfy any one of the condition to perform a task we use OR operator
->we can use or operator between the condition only
->The return-type is Boolean
->ex: int a=10;
int b=20;
System.out.println(a<b || ++a<b);//true
System.out.println(a);//10
System.out.println(b);//20

3)Not Operator:
->itis Unary Operator
->it is used to neget the value
->it can be used along with Boolean value or an expression which return Boolean value.
->the return-type is Boolean
ex:
System.out.println(!true);//false
System.out.println(!(10>20));//true
System.out.println(!(10+20));//CTE

**Flow control statements:
a statement which is used to control the flow of execution is known as Flow control statements.
1)Decision statements:
->a statement which is used to take the decision
->in java we have the following types:
i)Simple-if
ii)if-else
iii)else-if ladder
iv)Switch

i)Simple if:
->whenever we have only 1 condition(option) we use simple if
Syntax:
if(condition)
{
//java statements
}

ii)if-else:
->whenever we have 2 condition we use if-else
Syntax:
if(condition)
{
//java statements
}
else
{
//java statements
}
