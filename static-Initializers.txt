3)every global variable have default value.
4)we can access static variable of one class inside the static context of another class using class name with access operator.
5)we can global variable and local variable with the same name, the highest priority will be given to local variable.
6)global variable can be used through out the class but local variable can be used within the block where it is declared.

**Static-initializers:
static-initializers are used for the initialization purposes.
->we have 2 types of static initializers:
1)static declare & initialization statement 
2)static block

1)static declare & initialization statement :
syntax: static datatype identifier's =value/Expression;
ex: Static int a=10;

2)static block:
->an anonymous block which is prefixed with static modifiers known as static block.
Syntax: 
static
{
//java statements
}

*character of static block:
->Dont have a name
->Dont have a return type
->cannot accept values
->Cannot call it explicitly
->gets executed during loading process of a class

Loading process of a class:
->class static area is created and all the methods will be loaded to method area
->if static method are present the reference of static methods are stored inside class static area
->if static variable is present, memory will be allocated with in CSA and they will be assigned with default value.
->if static initializers are present, they get executed directly.
(only after this the main method will be called)
