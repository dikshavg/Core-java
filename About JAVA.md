### About JAVA:

#### 1)what is JAVA?

=java is a high level programming language which supports the OOPs principals like Encapsulation,Inheritance,Polymorphism,Abstraction.

#### \*Advantages of JAVA:

1)is a simple language

2)Structured language

3)oops

4)Robust

5)Platform independent

6)Multi-threads

7)Secure language

8)rich built in class

#### \*Platform dependent:

an application which is develop in one platform can be execute only in similar platform is known as platform dependent.

#### \*platform independent:

an application which is develop one platform can be execute in multiple different platform is known as platform independent.

================================================================================================================================================================================

#### 2)How java is platform independent?

=>java is 2-steps compilation language where java compiler converts Source file into class file.

=>The instruction inside the class file will be present in an intermediate level language known byte code.

=>The bytecode is understandable only by the machine which has the JVM(java virtual machine).

=>JVM read the instruction and executes them with respective machine by converting the instruction into machine understandable language hence java is a platform independent but depends on jvm.

#### \*steps to create a program and execute it:-

1)create a source file

2)create a class file

3)execute the program

===================================================================================================================================================================================

#### \*Structure of program:-

1)class block/global area

2)method block/local area



#### 1)class block:

=>is a place where we create members of class

=>we can have class without having members init. only problem is we cant execute it.



#### 2)main method:

=>is the method which starts the execution of program in java as well as ends it.
