polymorphism:
->it is the ability of the number to exhibit more than one frame is known as polymorphism.

*in java ,we can achieve polymorphism in two types:
1)compile time polymorphism
2)Runtime polymorphism

1)compile time polymorphism:
if which implementation of the number has to be used is decided by the complier time polymorphism
**there are following compile polymorphism:
a)Method Overloading
b)Constructor Overloading
c)Shadowing----->variable shadowing
	---->method shadowing
=========================================================================
a)Method Overloading:
-> A class having methods with same name but, different formal Arguments is known as method Overloading.

b)Constructor Overloading:
->A class having constructor with same name but different formal Arguments is known as constructor Overloading

c)Shadowing:
shadowing is nothing but having members with same or signature with in same class virtually.

------> variable shadowing:
->if both super class and sub class are having either static or non-static variable,with the same name then it is known as Variable shadowing.
-------> method shadowing:
->if both super class and sub class are having methods with same signature then we call it as method shadowing
