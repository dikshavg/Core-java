Loop:
->whenever we need to execute a statement or group of statement multiple times we use loop Statement
->in java we have following loops:
1)while
2)do-while
3)for loop
4)for each loop
5)Nested loop

*3 important segments of loop Statements are:
1)Inialization
2)Condition
3)Updation

1)while-loop:
->is used to execute a block of code multiple times based on the condition
Syntax:
while(condition)
{
//java Statements
}

2)do-while loop:
->whenever we need to execute a statement or group of statement minimum 1 time irrespective of a condition we use do-while loop.
Syntax:
do
{
//java statements
}

**Different between while loop and do-while loop:
while-loop:
->it is also called as Entry control loop
->0-iteration is minimum  possible

do-while loop:
->it is also called as exist control loop
->1-iteration is possible

3)for-loop:
Syntax:
for(initialization; condition; Updation)
{
//java Statements
}
