# INTRODUCTION:

================================

#### 1.what is program?

=set of instruction or block of code which are used to perform specific task known as program.

ex:{

int a=10;

int b=20;

int result=a+b;

s.o.pln(result);

}



#### 2.what is programing language?

=a language is used to write a program is known as programing language.

ex: java,python,c++,c etc.

============================================================================================================================================================================

#### 3.based on human understanding programming language is classified into 3 levels:-

(i)high-level language

(ii)mid-level language

(iii)low-level language



#### (i)high-level language:

=the language which is easily understandable \& easily readable is known as HLL.

ex: java,python



#### (ii)mid-level language:

=the language which is partial readable \& partial understandable compare to HLL is known as MLL.

ex: Microcontroller instruction set



#### (iii)Low-level language:

=the language which is not readable \& not understandable is known as LLL.

ex: Binary language(0's \& 1's)

==============================================================================================================================================================================

#### \##Binary language:

->it is a language which is understandable only by machine 

->in binary language we represents everything in the form of o's \& 1's.



#### \*Converting decimal to binary:

decimal value                 binary value

5                              101

18                             10010



#### \*Converting binary to decimal:

binary value                  decimal value

100101                        37

100001                        33

===============================================================================================================================================================================

#### 4.Understanding the memory:

1bit=we can store 2 number of bits.(total number of different values)

2bit=we can store 4 number of bits.

3bit=we can store 8 number of bits.

4bit=we can store 16 number of bits.



#### Formulas:

to find Maximum value that we can store inside number of bits is=2^n-1.

to find total number of different values we can store inside number of bits=2^n.

===============================================================================================================================================================================

#### 5.file:

Basically we have 2 types of files:

(i)Source file

(ii)Executable file



#### (i)Source file:

=A file inside which we write the instruction in HLL to develop an application is called source file.

=it is created by the programmer.

=ex:.java,.py,.MP3,.png,.txt,.pdf etc.



#### (ii)Executable file:

=a file which is required to execute an application is known as Executable file.

=inside executable file we have the instruction in machine understandable language Or Intermediate level language.
