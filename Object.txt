Object:
->object is a block of memory created inside a heap area during run-time.
->it is also called as instance of class
->syntax:
new classname();

*new:
->is a keyword
->it is a urinary Operator
->it will create block of memory,inside the heap area.
->the Address format is class name@ Hexadecimal

*Constructor:
->is a special type of non-static member which is used for Instastion and Initialization
->used to load the non-static members into the Object
===========================================================================================
**Non-Static variable:
->a global variable which is not prefixed with static is known as Non-static variable.
->it will have the memory allocation in the onject
->we can access static members inside the static context in the following ways:
1)Directly
2)with classname
#)with Address of an Object

**Non-static method:
->the method which is not prefix with static is known as non static method
->a block which is belongs to non static method is known as non static context
->every non static frame have the bulit in reference pointing to an Object
=============================================================================================
*THis:
->is a keyword
->is a non-static variable there for we can use only inside the non-static context
->this variable contains "Address of an object".

**Non-static Initilizers:
->we have 2 types:
1)non-static declare and initializers
2)non-static block

1)non-static declare and initializers:
->Syntax:
datatype identifiers=value/Expression;
int a=10;
->it will execute during the loading of each and every object created
->non-static initializers get executed during the loading process of an Object
